# COHIRADIA_RFCorder
Software for recording and playback of full RF bands up to 2.5 MHz with the STEMLAB125-14 by RedPitaya

This project aims at providing and further improving software 
for the playback and recording of RF signals in the context
of a project called COHIRADIA (...) presented in the virtual
radio museum www.radiomuseum.org. The original thread can be
seen by members of radiomuseum.org at: 
https://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/wideband_recording_of_historical_am_radiofrequency_bands.html

The aim of COHIRADIA is to archive entire radiofrequency bands 
(not just individual stations!) of the past on historical radio 
equipment and also to tune through in real time, see demo video:

https://cohiradia.radiomuseum.org/download/COHIRADIA_Demovideo_v1.mp4.

The recordings contain the original broadband
signals with all the carriers on the correct frequencies, 
specifically there is a collection of entire LW, MW and KW bands 
from 2006 onwards, recorded by members of radiomuseum.org. 

This was made possible by digitizing RF broadband signals which 
originally had been recorded on analog video tapes. As digitazing
platform the Software Defined Radio (SDR) STEMLAB125-14 by
Red Pitaya was used. 

Interested radio enthusiasts and collectors can play back 
these original radio signals on nearly all analog radio receivers
with an external antenna input.Also the own recording of 
currently transmitted signals from an 
antenna is possible with a bandwidth of up to 2.5 MHz.
