Welcome to COHIRADIA_Rfcorder's documentation!
==============================================

COHIRADIA_Rfcorder is a software for running projects of COHIRADIA

COHIRADIA is an acronym for CONservation of HIstorical RAdiofrequency bands by DIgital Archiving.

Goal: to give interested radio enthusiasts and collectors the opportunity to play back original radio signals that were recorded in the past, on historical radio receivers. These signals do not just represent a single station, but an entire frequency band with all the radio stations contained therein on the original carrier frequencies existing at the time of recording. 

COHIRADIA is hosted by www.radiomuseum.org on the URL: https://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_cohiradia.cfm

COHIRADIA contains a growing archive of recordings from 2006. So far data stem from long, medium and short wave up to 40 MHz. Until 2009 the antenna signals were recorded in analog form on a video recorder and digitized with a Software Defined Radio (SDR, STEMLAB125-14 ) from RedPitaya with 14 bit resolution in 2021. From 2021 records are preferentially made by direct digitalization with the SDR.

Any person who also possesses a STEMLAB125-14 can play back the data after downloading them from radiomuseum.org.  The necessary hardware and software as well as detailed information can be found in the video tutorials included in the respective software packages downloadable from radiomuseum.org. 

See a video example of playing back an archived file on an old tube radio:
